# Python Games Workspace

Welcome to the Python Games Workspace! This repository contains a collection of 110 simple Python game projects, each designed to help you learn and practice your Python programming skills.

## Overview

Each game is organized into its own directory under the `projects` folder. Inside each game directory, you will find:

- `main.py`: The main script that contains the game logic and execution flow.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the game, including instructions on how to play and any dependencies required.
